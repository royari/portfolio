import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

I'm Arindaam :) I build data infrastructure and distributed systems at [*<Underlining>Block, inc.</Underlining>*](https://block.xyz/) on the Data Mesh Platform team — think Kafka, Iceberg, and CDC pipelines at scale.

Got into software through [_CTF_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) challenges back in 2017. Breaking things taught me how to build them properly.

Before Block, I shipped production systems at an insurance-tech company, built the backend for an edtech startup from scratch (2M+ quizzes served), did [<Underlining>Google Summer of Code</Underlining>](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with DeepMind, and contributed to [<Underlining>Apache ResilientDB</Underlining>](https://resilientdb.apache.org/) where I'm now an Initial Committer and PPMC member.

MS in Computer Science from [<Underlining>UC Davis</Underlining>](https://cs.ucdavis.edu/).
